## 2. Programming in Python ##

#1. Instruct the computer to add two numbers together: 23 + 7

23+7

## 3. The print() Command ##

'''Using the print() command, display the result for:
    40 + 4
    200 - 25
    14 + 3'''

print(40+4)
print(200-25)
print(14+3)

## 4. Python Syntax ##

'''
Run the instructions below in the code editor on the right of the screen. Remember that each instruction must be on a separate line.
    print(30 + 10 + 40)
    print(4)
    print(-3)
'''
print(30 + 10 + 40)
print(4)
print(-3)

## 5. Computer Programs ##

'''
By using the print() command, write a program that has three lines of code and:

    Displays the result of 34 + 16.
    Displays the number 34.
    Displays the number -34.
'''
print(34+16)
print(34)
print(-34)

## 6. Code Comments ##

# Uncomment these three lines of code by removing the # symbols
# INITIAL CODE
print(34 + 16)
print(34)
print(-34)

## 7. Arithmetical Operations ##

'''
Write a program with three lines of code that performs the following arithmetical operations and displays the results (you'll need to use the print() command to display the results):
    16 × 10
    48 ÷ 5
    5³ (make sure you don't type 5^3 because ^ is not the symbol for exponentiation)
'''
print(16*10)
print(48/5)
print(5**3)
